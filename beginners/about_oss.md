# GCET-OSS

Before delving further, this doc provides a basic understanding
of what is what, for more detail you have to check specific docs,
and every doc has a first line just like this (before you delve)
you can read and know what the doc exactly explains.

GCET-OSS – the official open source community of Geethanjali College
of Engineering and Technology.
This is the home for projects, experiments, and contributions from
students and developers who believe in learning and building together.

The projects list will be listed in the site, you can visit and pick
any project that is hosted by GCET-OSS

## What is OSS

OSS stands for Open Source Software.
It is software where the source code is public so anyone can read,
learn, improve, and share it.

---

## Tips to Begin

Every good beginning needs a few hacks.
Start by reading the documentation in order. We have named
and ordered the directories carefully so you can move step
by step.
Always clone the repository and work with the code locally
instead of just browsing online.
Begin with small contributions such as fixing a typo or
improving a README before tackling larger issues.
Do not hesitate to ask questions. OSS is about learning together.

## Tech Stack

We use a modern but practical set of tools:

Git for version control and collaboration
Go (Golang) for backend and C for systems projects (why complicate life)
React for front-end web applications
Flutter for cross-platform mobile development

## Getting Started

### Git

For this specific section, we want you to delve
deeper in the `./cotribution_guidelines/git/a_git_summary.md`

As git is something which is crucial for contributing anything,
we want to seperate the docs, where everything that is enough
for contributing is given in the `a_git_summary.md`

### Go

Install Go from the official website.
Verify your installation:

```
go version
```

### React

Install Node.js and npm.
Create a new project:

```
npm create vite@latest
```
Keep a good note that we use Vite + Go lang as those are the standard languages.

### Flutter

Install the Flutter SDK from the official site.
Verify installation:

```
flutter doctor
```

## How to Contribute

Check the Issues tab for open tasks.
Comment on an issue and get assigned.
Create a new branch, make your changes, commit, and push.
Open a Pull Request and wait for review.
Iterate on feedback until the changes are merged.
If the issues are small, we fix it on our end.
Note that the code should pass all the valid test cases and have
a new set of test case in case of any behaviour changes.

Start with issues marked as "good first issue" if you are new.

## Learning Path

Absolute beginners can start with Git basics and small
documentation contributions.
Intermediate contributors can work on small Go, React, or Flutter projects.
Advanced contributors can take ownership of a project, design
new features, and mentor newcomers.

## Community Culture

We believe in respect, collaboration, and sharing knowledge.
There are no stupid questions.
Every member is both a learner and a teacher.
We celebrate small wins as much as big ones.
Also a big thing, we don't believe in formalities,
use brevity and conversational language, be direct
and just be open about everything.

---

## Recognition

Every contribution matters whether it is a single typo fix or
a full-fledged feature.
Active contributors are recognized in the community, credited
in project documentation, and build a portfolio that speaks louder than a CV.

## Final Note

Welcome to GCET-OSS. This is more than just code, it is a movement
of learning, building, and sharing.
Start reading the docs, set up your tools, and make your first
contribution today.

Open source is not just about software, it is about community.
